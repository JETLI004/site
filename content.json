For example see what Ikeja Electric did. Their main website is at ….. While their online payment site is at ielectri payments.com 2) You can register with an Online payment provider and create a payment link. Read more about that here:&nbsp; How Secure is this? We use SSL encryption to secure your payment website to ensure data is encrypted as it travels between your customer, your website and the payment company. We use very secure database SQL standard to ensure SQL injection attacks are not possible. We also enforce very strong passwords for you and your team. Even if someone somehow gets access to our system, they won’t have access to the payment provider and your bank at the same time. Your report will always show the amount reported by your bank&nbsp; How much can I receive? Are there limits? &nbsp;It depends on the payment provider company. However using a company like VoguePay costs just N2,500 for life for a full business account that can receive any amount and even from overseas&nbsp; How much are transaction fees?&nbsp; It’s at a minimum of 1.5% of the transaction access most of the payment service providers. For foreign transactions on VoguePay, it’s 3.8%. Can I monitor payments real time?&nbsp; Yes, we will setup a reporting platform where you can monitor your payments as they come in with details of the payment. You can have as many of your staff as you want setup to log in as well. However if you don’t setup a website and choose the “create payment link” option, you can view your reports when you login to the online payment provider website. You are limited to one user per account.&nbsp; PS this offer with not be here forever. We work on a 1st come and 1st served basis. Take action today and place your order.&nbsp; PSS make it easy for customers to pay you, it will always improve your income and sales in the long run.

Before I break it down for you let me tell you that it doesn’t work for a new business. You have to build your brand identity first which leads to trust before people are confident enough to pay you online. Back to the matter. What you could be loosingImagine you advertise your product to 5000 people using facebook adverts. If about 150 people visit your website, about 20 people may want to buy your product immediately. Assuming your product is priced at N3,500, you have a potential income of N75,000.00. Sounds great right, not quite Something terrible happens, you don’t accept online payments! So, some people will go ahead and place their order hoping to pay you on delivery, some will try to contact you to get your bank account details, some others will just go away. I had an experience recently, I was supposed to pay my son’s school fees. The school sent me instruction on how to pay by whatsapp and on reading through, I was supposed to get a bank draft or make a deposit in my son’s name into the school’s bank account and then come to the school with a copy of the bank teller/transfer receipt. It gets worse. Since I planned to pay for the school bus, I had to add the fee for “one way” school bus to the school fees. This had to be explained to the school later. For such a big school, this was too much stress for me. Read on to understand what is really going on and what you can do about it For an established business, your customers know you. They have purchased your products. They now know your brand. It becomes easy for them to pay you in any way you want especially online. Why a Customer may not Pay OnlineLet’s start with the psychology of making a sale A customer visits your website/Instagram and sees a product he likes There are a number of reasons why he may not pay at once Some are: He doesn’t like to buy things onlineHe doesn’t have money on the bank account where he can pay online or transfer from so he might want to make a transfer 1stHe doesn’t even have the money at allHe wants to see and touch the product before he pays for itHe might be using his phone to view the product and it’s convenient for him to pay on the phoneEtc.Let’s look at them one by one 1) He doesn’t like to buy things online - this is a major character of older people. The younger people like things easy so they are more likely to buy online. The only thing you can do here is to Target your adverts to younger people who are most likely to pay online and if that is not possible for your type of product, provide other payment options and way to follow up to close the sale. 2) He doesn’t have money on the bank account where he can pay online or transfer from so he might want to make a transfer 1st - People have money in different accounts for different reasons. I personally have 6 accounts which I use for different things. In your setup, people need to be able to pay you from any account with the greatest ease. The danger here is that, in trying to move money from one account to another, there may be network failure, the payment may leave one account and fail to get to the other account, he might get a phone call and forgets about the whole thing and so on. What if the person can just dial a code from his phone to pay you from the bank where his money is without the need to move money around? That would be awesome. 3) He doesn’t even have the money at all - since he indicated interest, you may want to get him to join your mailing list so you can keep the conversation. That way, when he has money, he will usually come back to you and hopefully make a purchase. See my top recommendation on how to Setup a Mailing List System that Automatically Reminds Customers and Prospects to Come and Buy from You 4) He wants to see and touch the product before he pays for it - this is the best for new businesses. You don’t want to put the customer under pressure to pay and come off looking suspicious. You offer a sort of pay on delivery payment option. When I started buying from Nigerian online shops, I would always use the pay on delivery option but after a few successful purchases, I started paying online when I order It’s part of the buying psychology, once a customer has come to trust you, he will pay online. 5) He might be using his phone to view the product and it’s not convenient for him to pay on the phone - for such customers, not paying may not be because they don’t have the money. It just not convenient. Imagine going through your Instagram at 1am while sitting through a boring party and you come across an advert or a product you like, I bet you will find a way to note the name of the page and come back later- which doesn’t happen 50% of the time. You forget to come back. You have to find a way to offer something that enables you to remind the customer later. This can be achieved by offering a free download when the customer submits an email address. You can read more about this here So how do we setup online payment?There are a number online payment providers in Nigeria but in choosing one, you have to look out for the ones that give you the greatest number of ways which customer can pay you.

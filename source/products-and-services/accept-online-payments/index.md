<p><strong>You see l've been in this situation as a customer. Let me tell you about it.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I once wanted to pay my Son's fees to a big school here in Lagos. They sent me details of how to pay to my WhatsApp. When I read it, I saw that I was supposed to get a bank draft in my son's name and send to them or I transfer to their account and send them the transfer receipt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Really?&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was surprised.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For such a good sum of money from from a lot of parents within the same period, it must be a bit of a nightmare confirming all those payments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is where an online payment system can help: parents pay from their homes, and you get your money into your account and also you confirm all the payments automatically.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Frequency Asked Questions&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><em>What if I don't have a website?&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">We can make one for you at very affordable price but if you are not ready for a website now you have two options: 1) We make a website for you just for making payment. For example see what Ikeja Electric did. Their main website is at ..... While their online payment site is at ielectri payments.com 2) You can register with an Online payment provider and create a payment link. Read more about that here:&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><em>How Secure is this? </em></strong></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">We use SSL encryption to secure your payment website to ensure data is encrypted as it travels between your customer, your website and the payment company. We use very secure database SQL standard to ensure SQL injection attacks are not possible. We also enforce very strong passwords for you and your team. Even if someone somehow gets access to our system, they won't have access to the payment provider and your bank at the same time. Your report will always show the amount reported by your bank&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>How much can I receive? Are there limits?</strong></em></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;It depends on the payment provider company. However using a company like VoguePay costs just N2,500 for life for a full business account that can receive any amount and even from overseas&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>How much are transaction fees?&nbsp;</strong></em></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">It's at a minimum of 1.5% of the transaction access most of the payment service providers. For foreign transactions on VoguePay, it's 3.8%.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Can I monitor payments real time?&nbsp;</strong></em></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Yes, we will setup a reporting platform where you can monitor your payments as they come in with details of the payment. You can have as many of your staff as you want setup to log in as well. However if you don't setup a website and choose the "create payment link" option, you can view your reports when you login to the online payment provider website. You are limited to one user per account.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><u>PS this offer with not be here forever. We work on a 1st come and 1st served basis. Take action today and place your order.&nbsp;</u></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><u><u>PSS mak</u>e it easy for customers to pay you, it will always improve your income and sales in the long run. You set it once and forget it, it's as easy as that.</u></p>
